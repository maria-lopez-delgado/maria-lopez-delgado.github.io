# ¡Hola!

### I’m Maria!

I’m passionate about **collaborating** with a **diverse** **team** to design **intuitive** solutions for **complex** systems.

I bring my **background in education** to all design projects. By making sure **users** with **diverse** **backgrounds** and **mental models** can easily **understand**, **learn**, and **use** the systems. And more importantly, **design** solutions that are **user-centric** and **accessible** for all.

With a keen eye for **observing** design decisions, I closely **analyze** that work and what could be **improved** to increase **usability** and user retention.
