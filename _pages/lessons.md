[1] Mental model alignment as a designer
    * As a designer, I was lost in understanding and aligning my mental model when tasked to design Nexus, a data catalog to support the digital twin life cycle. I researched examples and expected interactions. And found it is similar to a library catalog, something I’m very familiar with. Because I was able to align my mental model to the design requirements, I was able to design better, and it aligned with the expected interaction. 
        * For example, when designing the advanced search section, I leverage my own mental models of interacting with a library catalog to align it with Nexus. In particular, focusing on interaction users are familiar with using, like being able to determine filters, add text they want to look for, and use Boolean operators.
    * So as designers, we need to make sure we truly understand what we are task is, look at the competitors and potential users' familiarity.

[2] Adapting to user goals for interaction
* It is key to understand how users will want to interact with the tool. There might be circumstances for limited or no interaction with potential or current users. In speaking with the project owner, it might be an option to gauge an understanding of how the tool might be useful for users to interact with. 
    * For example, when designing the data catalog landing page, the initial understanding was that users would only want to search within one project. After conversing with the project owner, the UX team realized that there might be use cases where users would like to do data discovery across several projects. Adding the ability to easily select in what projects users want to search was an excellent example of anticipating and adapting to user needs.
* There is still a need to talk to potential users and see if the anticipated use case is needed and would improve the user experience.

[3] Understanding current users
* When starting a new project, it is fundamental to get to know and understand current users. When starting redesign work for DeepLynx, a data lake tool to support the life cycle of digital twins. The UX team was concerned that we needed to know more about your current users. When proposing a meeting with current users, the development team indicated there was a short deadline and limited resources. In so the UX team, in collaboration with the development team, created a survey for current users. We wanted to understand what tools they were familiar with, their role in the company, their work style, their experiences, and how they interacted with the current version of the tool. From this data, we developed user personas that help guide mockup redesign. It also helped the development team understand the reasoning behind some of the design decisions.

[4] Identifying potential user problems
* In redesigning DeepLynx, the UX team was not able to meet 1-1 with current users to gather their issues with the current user interface. To identify the problems we needed to address in the redesign, we leveraged Nielsen’s Heuristic Evaluation. This evaluation also helped justify to the development team why we needed to address those changes.

[5] Improving usability, but not aligning with users’ mental model
* When redesigning DeepLynx, the UX team identified some complex interactions and proposed a simplified redesign. During user testing, using the think-aloud method, it was clear that the proposed redesign did not align with their mental model and expected interaction. Sadly, it was at the end of the internship, and we couldn’t address another design solution. But it was a great opportunity to reinforce the need for user testing before implementation, and especially when redesigning a complex interaction.

[6] Translate requirements
*Understand requirements as shared to developers by stakeholders*
* While working in Spectra, a digital twin model viewer, an engineer handed his version of the design based on his conversations with the client.
    * It became a wonderful opportunity to understand the engineer’s perspective on requirements and design. 
    * In this case,  it was concerning the addition of a schedule to show the progress in construction, concurrent with the visualization in a Unity scene. I was handed a sketch and told to make it look pretty. And of course, I could make it look pretty, but I could make it more intuitive and informative for the user.  
        * In so I suggested 
            * Prioritize and organize content for users to quickly scan information needed to view the progress of the project
            * Multiple indications of the status of construction to correspond not only to highlights in the Unity scene when selecting an element, but solo next to the name to quickly see progress. 
            * Use of color and symbols to quickly gauge if the part is online or offline
            * An individual progress bar for each individual element to gauge the progress of construction.  
* While not being able to talk with potential users or clients, I was able to gain some insight from the engineer and optimize the design to be more intuitive and useful for users.
